SQL Part 1 Evaluation

What does SQL stand for?

SQL stands for structured query language. It is a programming language designed for managing and querying relational databases. SQL is used to communicate with a database. It is the standard language for relational database management systems.

In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement?

The SELECT statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows us to specify the columns we want to retrieve, apply filters to narrow down the results, perform calculations, and even join multiple tables together to extract the desired information.
It is the most frequently used DML command.
example: SELECT * FROM Customer; 


How do you create a new table in SQL?

The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.

Syntax : CREATE TABLE table_name (
    col1 datatype,
    col2 datatype,
   ... );
Example: CREATE TABLE Interns (
    InternID int,
    LastName varchar(30),
    FirstName varchar(30),
    Address varchar(50),
    City varchar(30)
);

What is SQL

1.What does SQL stand for?

SQL stands for structured query language. It is a programming language designed for managing and querying relational databases. SQL is used to communicate with a database. It is the standard language for relational database management systems.

2.In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement?

The SELECT statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows us to specify the columns we want to retrieve, apply filters to narrow down the results, perform calculations, and even join multiple tables together to extract the desired information.
It is the most frequently used DML command.

example: SELECT * FROM Customer; 

Create Table

3.How do you create a new table in SQL?
The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.

Syntax : CREATE TABLE table_name (
    col1 datatype,
    col2 datatype,
   ... );
Example: CREATE TABLE Interns (
    InternID int,
    LastName varchar(30),
    FirstName varchar(30),
    Address varchar(50),
    City varchar(30)
);

4.Write a Create statement with primary key in a SQL table, why is it important?

CREATE TABLE Intern (
    InternId integer PRIMARY KEY, 
    FirstName varchar(20), 
    LastName varchar(20), 
    Email varchar(30), 
    PhoneNo varchar(20), 
    Salary integer
);

or

CREATE TABLE industries (
  name varchar(100) ,
  producer varchar(100),
  PRIMARY KEY(producer)
);

A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must contain unique and non-null values. A table can have only one primary key.
Alter Table

5.How can you add a new column to an existing table in SQL?
ALTER TABLE command is used to add a new column to the existing database table.

for a single column to add;

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name data_type;

for multiple columns to add:

ALTER TABLE table_name 
ADD col_name1 data_type,
    col_name2 data_type,
    ADD col_nameN data_typeN;

6.What is the purpose of the ALTER TABLE statement in SQL?

An existing table's columns can be added, removed, or modified using the SQL ALTER TABLE statement. On already-existing tables, the ALTER TABLE statement can also be used to add and remove different constraints.

Rename Columns

7.How do you rename a column in an SQL table?

we can rename a column by using the table with ALTER TABLE table_name and then write which column to rename and what to rename it to with RENAME COLUMN old_name TO new_name.

syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN old_name TO new_name;

8.Why might you want to rename a column in a SQL table?

To keep the database organized, we might need to change the names of the columns.
Modify Column Datatype Size

9.How do you modify the datatype size of an existing column in SQL?

ALTER command is used to modify the structure of existing tables in the database.
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN col_name VARCHAR(50);

10.Why might you need to modify the datatype size of a column?

Modifying the data type size of a column that already contains data can be for following reasons:
1. Data requirements change
2. Performance optimization
3. Data integrity

Delete Columns

11.How can you delete a column from an existing table in SQL?

syntax: 
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN Col_name;

12.What considerations should be taken before deleting a column from a table?

1. Imapct on Data : how deleting the column will affect data stored in the table.
2. Performance : might improve query performance by reducing amount of data stored in the table.
3. backup : a copy of data if anything goes wrong
4. Primary and foreign key considerations

Rename Table

13.How do you rename a table in SQL?

ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN old_name TO new_name;

14.In what situations might you need to rename a table?

Database administrators and users may want to change the name of the table in the SQL database because they want to give a more relevant name to the table.

Drop Table

15.How do you delete or remove an entire table from a database in SQL?

DROP TABLE statement is used to delete a table with data from the database.
syntax:
DROP TABLE table_name

16.What precautions should be taken before dropping a table?

1. Make a backup of the database.
2. Double-check that you are dropping the correct table.
3. Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions to drop the table.
4. Make sure you do not need any of the data in the table.

Null Value

17.What does a NULL value represent in a database?

A null value in a relational database is used when the value in a column is unknown or missing. NULL values are those values in which there is no data value in the particular field in the table.

18.How can you insert a NULL value into a column during data insertion?

SQL INSERT statement can be used to insert NULL value into a column.

syntax:

INSERT INTO interns
VALUES ("A001","Ram","benagluru",NULL);

or

inserting NULL values into specific columns

INSERT INTO agents
(agent_code,agent_name,commission)
VALUES ("A001","Ram",NULL)
