What is MVC pattern?

MVC stands for Model View Controller

MVC is an ARCHITECTURAL design pattern. It means this design pattern is used at the architecture level of an application.

Model, View and Controller are the main components of mvc pattern

Role of each component?

Model is responsible for data
View is responsible for UI(User Interface)
Controller is responsible for the flow of application by accepting user input.

Understanding Controller?

A controller is a .cs(for c#) file which has some methods called action methods.

when a request comes on controller, it actually hits an action method.

Now everything depends on Action method what to return from it . It may return only view, only data or both of them.
