Certainly! Letâ€™s delve into the differences between useMemo, useEffect, and useState in React, and understand when to use each one.

useState:
Purpose: useState is primarily used for managing state within functional components. It allows you to declare and update state variables.
Behavior:
When you call useState, it returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that state.
It triggers a re-render when you invoke the update function.
It doesnâ€™t have any dependencies like useMemo or useEffect.
Use Case:
Use useState when you need to manage component-specific state that affects rendering and reactivity.

useMemo:
Purpose: useMemo is used for memoization, which means caching the result of a computationally expensive function to avoid unnecessary re-computations.
Behavior:
It runs during the render phase of the component.
It recalculates a value only if the elements in its dependency array change.
If the dependency array is empty, it recalculates only once (similar to a constant).
Use Case:
Use useMemo when you have a costly function that you want to memoize, especially when the functionâ€™s result doesnâ€™t change unless its dependencies change.
useEffect:
Purpose: useEffect is used for handling side effects (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions, DOM manipulation) in functional components.
Behavior:
It runs after each render.
If you provide a dependency array, it runs only when the dependencies change.
If the dependency array is empty, it runs once during initial mount (and unmount if you return a cleanup function).
Use Case:
Use useEffect when you need to perform actions after rendering, such as fetching data, updating the DOM, or managing subscriptions.
In summary:

useState for managing component-specific state.
useMemo for memoizing expensive computations.
useEffect for handling side effects and controlling updates.
Remember that these hooks serve distinct purposes, and understanding their differences helps you write effective React components. ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ
