The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface implemented by browsers to make static websites functional.


The DOM API can be used to change the document structure, style, and content.


The API is so powerful that countless frontend frameworks (jQuery, React, Angular, etc.) have been developed around it to make dynamic websites even easier to develop.


TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, and it ships type definitions for the DOM API.


Use babel for transpiling and tsc for type checking


TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScript using a compiler.


TypeScript will throw an error if data types do not match.


TypeScript has special types that may not refer to any specific type of data.


Type: any
anyÂ is a type that disables type checking and effectively allows all types to be used.


unknown is a similar, but safer alternative to any.


Casting is when we use the "as" keyword to say property or variable is of the casted type.

Certainly! The `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses are used together in SQL queries to retrieve a subset of rows from a result set.

- **LIMIT**: The `LIMIT` clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query. It specifies the maximum number of rows to return.

- **OFFSET**: The `OFFSET` clause is used to skip a specified number of rows before starting to return rows from the query. It specifies the starting point within the result set.

When used together, `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` allow you to retrieve a specific subset of rows from the result set. For example:

- `LIMIT 1`: Returns only the first row from the result set.
- `LIMIT 10`: Returns the first 10 rows from the result set.
- `LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10`: Skips the first 10 rows and returns the next 5 rows from the result set.

In the context of finding the second highest element:

1. The result set is ordered in descending order (`ORDER BY column_name DESC`), so the highest value is at the top.
2. `LIMIT 1` restricts the result set to just the first row, which contains the highest value.
3. `OFFSET 1` skips the first row, so the result set starts from the second row, which effectively gives us the second highest value.

Therefore, `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1` retrieves the second highest element from the sorted result set.


SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
